# 🧠 AI & Robotics Learning Tracker

This repository documents my weekly progress toward becoming a Robotics + AI Software Engineer, with the goal of securing an internship in Summer 2026.

## 🚧 Project Deliverables
### Week 1 — Environment Setup
- Created GitHub repository: ai_robotics_tracker
- Initialized project structure and README
- Installed core libraries: requests, pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl

### Week 2 — API + JSON Plotter
- Built a Python pipeline that fetches weather JSON data (Open-Meteo)
- Converted JSON → Pandas DataFrame → plotted time-series graph
- Practiced:
    - requests for API calls
    - pandas for data processing
    - matplotlib for visualization

## 🤖 Robotics / AI Practice
### Week 1 — Foundation & Setup
- Installed robotics-related libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, requests, opencv-python
- Verified Python environment (python --version, pip list)
- Explored how JSON and arrays represent real-world sensor streams
- Watched “ROS2 Explained in 15 Minutes” for conceptual overview

### Week 2 — Numerical Foundations
- Strengthened vector/matrix intuition using NumPy
- Implemented dot and cross products by hand and with NumPy
- Visualized 2D motion with Matplotlib
- Key concept learned: “Robotics is math in motion.”

### Week 3 — PID Control Simulation
- Watched “PID Control Explained: Ultimate Guide”
- Simulated P, PI, and PID controllers in Python
- Observed overshoot, settling behavior, and steady-state error
- Produced visual comparison of P vs PI vs PID
- Code: src/robotics/pid_control_demo.py
- Plot: data/robotics/pid_tuning_ccomparison.png

## 💡 NeetCode / Algorithms
### Week 1 — Sliding Window Patterns
- Practiced:
    - Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock
    - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
    - Longest Repeating Character Replacement
    - Permutation in String
    - Minimum Window Substring
    - Sliding Window Maximum

### Week 2 — Linked List Patterns
- Practiced:
    - Reverse Linked List
    - Merge Two Sorted Lists
    - Reorder List
    - Remove Nth Node From End of List
    - Copy List With Random Pointer

## 🌐 Networking Progress
### Week 1 — Profile Setup
- Updated LinkedIn profile
- Added Merrimack MSCS (AI) information
- Posted an intro about starting graduate studies
- Followed 10 companies in AI/Robotics

### Week 2 — Connect & Observe
- Sent 10+ connection requests to Merrimack classmates
- Joined 3 LinkedIn communities on AI/Robotics
- Followed two open-source robotics repositories:
    - ros2/ros2
    - cyberbotics/webots
